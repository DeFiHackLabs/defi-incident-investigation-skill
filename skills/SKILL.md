# DeFi Incident Investigation

## When to Use

- User asks to investigate a DeFi hack and produce a detailed report JSON
- User provides reference URLs (X posts, blog analyses, post-mortems) for an incident
- User provides insufficient or mismatched sources — the skill autonomously searches the web to fill information gaps
- Need to verify an existing JSON report against on-chain data

## Output

A single JSON file conforming to `templates/schema.json`. File naming: `YYYYMMDD-ProtocolName.json`. See `templates/schema-guide.md` for field documentation.

## Subagent Roles

This skill uses platform-agnostic delegated-agent terminology:

- **research agent**: A delegated agent optimized for focused data extraction and factual verification. Cannot delegate further.
- **general agent**: A delegated agent that investigates broadly and may spawn focused research agents.
- **adversarial validator**: A delegated agent that acts as a skeptical reviewer, assuming all report claims are false until proven against on-chain data.

### Harness Mapping

The table below maps the platform-agnostic roles to concrete tools in each supported harness. If your harness is not listed, use whatever subagent/delegation mechanism it provides. If it has no delegation capability, run all phases sequentially in the main agent.

| Role | Hermes | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| research agent | `delegate_task` with `role="leaf"` | `Task` tool with a focused prompt | Run in main agent (no built-in subagent) | `Task` tool with a focused prompt |
| general agent | `delegate_task` with `role="orchestrator"` | `Task` tool, then spawn more `Task` calls | Run in main agent | `Task` tool, then spawn more `Task` calls |
| adversarial validator | `delegate_task` with `role="leaf"` in a separate session | `Task` tool with a "prove this wrong" prompt | Run in main agent with explicit "assume all claims are false" instruction | `Task` tool with a "prove this wrong" prompt |

**When delegation is unavailable:** The main agent runs all phases sequentially itself. Phase 6 (Adversarial Validation) must still be performed — the agent re-reads the final JSON from disk and re-verifies all claims with a skeptical mindset, as if it were a different agent.

## Checkpoint System

Every phase writes a checkpoint JSON to `/tmp/defi-incident-<incidentId>/`. This enables resume after timeout, token limit, or interruption.

Checkpoint file format:
```json
{
  "phase": "intel|enrichment|draft|verify|report|adversarial|finalize",
  "status": "in_progress|completed|failed",
  "input": "<what was provided to this phase>",
  "result": "<what this phase produced>",
  "output": "<artifacts written (file paths, tx hashes verified, etc.)>",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

Before starting any phase, check if a checkpoint exists. If found and status="completed", skip to next phase. If "in_progress" or "failed", review the partial result and resume from where it left off.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Intel Gathering (general agent)

**Goal:** Extract all available information from user-provided reference URLs.

1. Read all provided URLs. For X/Twitter URLs, use the vxtwitter API (`https://api.vxtwitter.com/Twitter/status/<TWEET_ID>`) — it requires no auth and returns full tweet text, media URLs, threaded tweets, and quoted tweets. Use `vision_analyze` on `mediaURLs` to extract on-chain data from tweet images. For other URLs, use `browser_navigate` + `browser_console` for JavaScript-rendered pages. Extract full article content including code blocks, addresses, tx hashes. **Note:** vxtwitter truncates tweets at ~1000 chars; for long technical threads from security firms, always use `browser_navigate` + `browser_console(expression="document.body.innerText")` as a fallback to get the complete text. If a URL returns 404 (page not found), exclude it from references and continue — do not block the investigation on a single dead URL if other sources cover the same information.
2. If anti-crawler / Cloudflare blocks access: ask the user to manually visit the page and paste content. Do not attempt to bypass.
3. If API keys are needed (Etherscan, etc.): follow the **API Key Resolution Protocol** (see section below). Do not guess or fabricate keys.
4. Extract entities: protocol name, blockchain(s), attacker addresses, victim contracts, tx hashes, loss figures, attack timeline, attack method.
5. Cross-reference extracted entities with external databases. See `references/data-sources.md`.
6. Write checkpoint: `phase=intel, status=completed, result=<extracted entities JSON>`.

### Phase 2: Source Gap Analysis & Autonomous Enrichment (main agent)

**Goal:** When user-provided sources are insufficient to reconstruct the full incident, autonomously search the web for additional information using extracted keywords.

This phase operates in optimistic-trust mode: the skill is expected to run in a sandboxed environment, so the agent may freely use all available tools without additional permission prompts. See `references/data-sources.md` → Autonomous Web Search Strategy.

1. **Assess intel completeness.** Review the Phase 1 entity extraction result. A source gap exists if any critical piece is missing or ambiguous:
   - Attack timeline (start time, duration)
   - Root cause (what vulnerability was exploited)
   - Attack vector (how the exploit was executed)
   - Loss breakdown (what was stolen, approximate USD value)
   - Attacker address(es) and victim contract address(es)
   - Transaction hash(es) of the exploit
   - Post-mortem / remediation actions by the protocol
2. **Detect target mismatch.** Compare the user's stated investigation target (from their original prompt) against the entities extracted from provided URLs. If they don't match (e.g., user asks about "October 2021 Cream Finance" but URLs are about "August 2021 Cream Finance"), flag this as a source gap — the provided URLs describe a different incident.
3. **If no gap exists:** Skip to Phase 3. Write checkpoint: `phase=enrichment, status=completed, result="no gap detected, skipped"`.
4. **If a gap exists:** Extract search keywords from:
   - The user's original prompt (protocol name, date/timeframe, chain, incident type)
   - The provided source URLs (any entities that can refine the search, ignoring mismatched elements)
5. **Search for additional sources.** Use Browser and Search Engine tools to find:
   - Audit reports
   - Security incident alerts
   - Attack clues and on-chain traces
   - Attack analysis reports
   - Post-mortem reports
   - Official protocol statements and remediation actions
6. **Process discovered URLs.** For each newly discovered URL, run the same content extraction as Phase 1. Merge new intel with existing Phase 1 intel.
7. **Track provenance.** In the checkpoint, separate user-provided sources from autonomously discovered sources. Both are valid for the investigation — the distinction is for transparency and reproducibility.
8. **Write checkpoint:** `phase=enrichment, status=completed, result=<merged intel JSON with source provenance>`.

### Phase 3: Schema Draft (main agent)

**Goal:** Produce a draft JSON report from intel.

1. Read `templates/schema.json` for field requirements and valid enum values.
2. Read `templates/schema-guide.md` for field constraints, extensible fields workflow, common compliance errors, and the validation snippet.
3. Map extracted entities to schema fields. For any vocabulary key that doesn't fit, add a new key to `schema.json` `_metadata` (see Extensible Fields in schema-guide.md).
4. Set `metadata.human_verified = false`.
5. Write draft JSON to `/tmp/defi-incident-<incidentId>/draft.json`.
6. Write checkpoint: `phase=draft, status=completed, result=<draft.json path>`.

### Phase 4: On-Chain Verification (research agent)

**Goal:** Verify every tx hash, address, amount, and timestamp against on-chain data.

1. Read `references/onchain-verification.md` for multi-chain RPC patterns and Etherscan V2 API usage.
2. Read `references/pitfalls/general.md` for known verification traps.
3. **Important:** Cache all API responses to disk during Phase 1. Reuse cached data here instead of re-querying. If the API key gets rate-limited (see Pitfall #16), switch to public RPC (e.g., `https://1rpc.io/eth` for Ethereum). Add `time.sleep(1)` between RPC calls to avoid 429 (see Pitfall #19). If an RPC call returns `None`/`null` as the result (not `"0x"`, not an error), treat it as a transient failure and retry from a different endpoint — do NOT classify based on a `None` result (see Pitfall #20).
4. For every `txHash` in the draft:
   - Call `eth_getTransactionByHash` (or equivalent for the chain) — verify tx exists, `from`/`to` match, `status == 0x1` (SUCCESS)
   - Call `eth_getBlockByNumber` — verify block timestamp matches `attackTime`
   - Decode `input` selector — verify it matches the claimed function
   - For mint/transfer: decode amount and verify against report
5. For every `address` in `attackers[]` and `victims[]`:
   - Call `eth_getCode` at BOTH `latest` AND `hex(attackBlock)` — verify `accountType` (EOA vs Contract vs EIP-7702). The accountType should reflect the state at the attack block, not at `latest` (see Pitfall #17).
6. For `estimatedLoss`: sum on-chain amounts by decoding Transfer events from the drain tx receipt, verify total matches report
7. Record all discrepancies. Fix the draft JSON accordingly.
8. Write checkpoint: `phase=verify, status=completed, result=<verified draft.json path, discrepancies list>`.

### Phase 5: Report Generation (main agent)

**Goal:** Produce the final JSON report file.

1. Read the verified draft from Phase 4 output.
2. Write the final JSON to the user's requested output path (or `/tmp/defi-incident-<incidentId>/report.json` if no path specified).
3. Validate against schema: run `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('<path>'))"` to confirm valid JSON. Check all required fields present. Check all enum values valid.
4. Write checkpoint: `phase=report, status=completed, result=<final report path>`.

### Phase 6: Adversarial Validation (adversarial validator agent)

**Goal:** Independently re-verify the FINAL JSON against on-chain data, assuming all claims are false until proven.

This is a SECOND verification pass, independent of Phase 4. The adversarial validator must:

1. **Re-read the final JSON from disk** (not from memory).
2. **For every `txHash`**: re-verify on-chain. If tx NOT FOUND → CRITICAL (fabricated hash). If `status == 0x0` → CRITICAL (failed tx included as success). If selector doesn't match description → CRITICAL.
3. **For every `address`**: re-verify `accountType` via `eth_getCode`. Mismatch → CRITICAL.
4. **For aggregate claims**: re-sum on-chain amounts. Off by >1% → CRITICAL.
5. **For `attackTime`**: re-verify from block timestamps. Off by >1 min → HIGH.
6. **Logical consistency**: check that `description`, `rootCause`, and `attackVector` do not contradict each other or the on-chain evidence. Inconsistency → HIGH.
7. **Source figures**: if a source figure was adopted without on-chain cross-check → HIGH.
8. Produce a verdict: PASS / FAIL with discrepancy list (severity: Critical / High / Medium).

Discrepancy severity:
- **Critical**: fabricated address, wrong accountType, wrong tx hash, wrong selector, amount off by >1% → must fix
- **High**: timestamp off by >1 min, source figure adopted without cross-check, logical inconsistency → fix or annotate
- **Medium**: minor rounding → fix if easy, otherwise annotate

If verdict is FAIL: return to Phase 5, fix all Critical and High discrepancies, re-run Phase 6.

Write checkpoint: `phase=adversarial, status=completed, result=<verdict + discrepancy list>`.

### Phase 7: Finalize (main agent)

1. Present the final report path and adversarial validation verdict to the user.
2. Wait for user confirmation ("apply it" / "flip it" / "looks good").
3. Only after user confirmation: set `metadata.human_verified = true` and update `metadata.lastUpdated`.
4. Write checkpoint: `phase=finalize, status=completed`.

## API Key Resolution Protocol (Cross-Harness)

This protocol ensures consistent API key handling across all agent harnesses (Hermes, OpenCode, Claude Code, etc.). It is written as a behavioral specification — the agent follows these steps using whatever user-interaction mechanism its harness provides.

### Service Registry

| Service | Key Variable | Where to Look | Required For |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Etherscan V2 | `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.env`, env vars | ETH/BSC txlist, tokentx, contract source |
| BSCScan | Same as Etherscan | Same | BSC-specific queries |
| Blockscout | None | N/A | Fallback for Etherscan — no key needed |
| Public RPC | None | N/A | eth_getTransactionByHash, getCode, getBlockByNumber |
| X/Twitter API | `XURL_*` in `~/.xurl` | `~/.xurl` | xurl CLI (optional — vxtwitter is keyless) |
| CoinGecko | None | N/A | Historical ETH/token prices |

### Resolution Procedure (for each service the investigation needs)

Execute these steps IN ORDER. Stop at the first step that succeeds:

1. **Check environment variables.** Run `env | grep -i <KEY_VAR>` or read `~/.zshenv` / `~/.zshrc` / `~/.env` / `~/.bashrc` for the key. If found, use it.

2. **Ask the user (Human-in-the-Loop).** If the key is not found, stop and ask the user:
   - State which service needs the key and why (e.g., "I need an Etherscan API key to fetch the attacker's transaction list — this data is not available via public RPC.")
   - State what the key will be used for specifically.
   - Ask the user to provide the key or to set it in a file.
   - WAIT for the user's response before proceeding. Do not skip this step or guess a key.

3. **If the user provides the key:** Use it immediately. Do not write it to any file unless the user explicitly asks.

4. **If the user cannot provide the key, or does not respond:** Fall back to the alternative path for that service (see Fallback Paths below). Continue the investigation. Do not block the entire investigation on a single missing key.

5. **If the key is found but rate-limited / blocked:** Switch to the fallback path immediately. Do not retry the blocked key. Note the issue in the checkpoint.

### Fallback Paths (when a key is missing or blocked)

| Service | Primary Path (with key) | Fallback Path (no key) |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Etherscan (ETH) | `api.etherscan.io/v2/api` | Public RPC: `https://1rpc.io/eth` for all JSON-RPC methods. Blockscout: `https://eth.blockscout.com/api/v2/` for tx lists, token transfers, contract source. |
| Etherscan (BSC) | Same key, `chainid=56` (paid) | Public BSC RPC: `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/` for JSON-RPC. Blockscout: `https://bsc.blockscout.com/api/v2/`. |
| X/Twitter | xurl CLI with OAuth | vxtwitter API: `https://api.vxtwitter.com/Twitter/status/<id>` (keyless, returns full tweet text + media). Browser navigation for threads. |
| CoinGecko | Free tier (10 calls/min) | Hardcode approximate price from source tweets, note as "estimated" in report. |

### What NOT to Do

- Do NOT fabricate or guess API keys.
- Do NOT silently skip a data source because the key is missing — ask first, fall back second.
- Do NOT write API keys into report files, checkpoints, or any output that may be shared.
- Do NOT block the investigation entirely if a key is missing — always have a fallback path.
- Do NOT store user-provided keys in memory longer than needed for the current investigation.
